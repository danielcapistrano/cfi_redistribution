However, for lower-grade service class and small business owners, there seems to be a break in this trajectory captured in the latest wave (Figure 4.2)",

Margalit and Raviv (2024) argues that reduction in income differences is too abstract and respondents in general do not link it to redistributive measures. Similarly, it has been suggested that this question only captures a diffuse inclination to equality and that is why responses are inconsistent with voting preferences across countries Dallinger (2022). However, Breznau et al. (2025) argue that the absence of a relationship between this measurement and other expected correlates (voting preferences / support for concrete policies) is due to the ommission of views on government (trust and perceptions of corruption) as a moderating variable.\n\n\nRelevant variables\nHere are relevant variables from the latest three waves that were also included in the analysis.\n\nPlacement on left right scale\n\nCitizen of country\n\nBorn in country\n\nGender\n\nYear of birth\n\nHighest level of education\n\nFeeling about household’s income nowadays\n\nIn addition, based on the class scheme developed by Oesch (2006), a “social class” variable was constructed based on occupational variables and following Tawfik and Oesch (2020) script.\n\n\n\n\nBreznau, Nate, Lisa Heukamp, Hung HV Nguyen, and Tom Knuf. 2025. “The Moderating Role of Government Heuristics in Public Preferences for Redistribution.” Journal of European Social Policy 35 (1): 21–39. https://doi.org/10.1177/09589287241290742.\n\n\nDallinger, Ursula. 2022. “On the Ambivalence of Preferences for Income Redistribution: A Research Note.” Journal of European Social Policy 32 (2): 225–36. https://doi.org/10.1177/09589287211066469.\n\n\nMargalit, Yotam, and Shir Raviv. 2024. “Does Support for Redistribution Mean What We Think It Means?” Political Science Research and Methods 12 (4): 870–78. https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2023.57.\n\n\nOesch, Daniel. 2006. “Coming to Grips with a Changing Class Structure: An Analysis of Employment Stratification in Britain, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.” International Sociology 21 (2): 263–88. https://doi.org/10.1177/0268580906061379.\n\n\nTawfik, Amal, and Daniel Oesch. 2020. “Script to Construct an Indicator of Social Class in the ESS.” Https://Www.

The only exception is the average for “social benefits place too great strain on economy”, which oberved a significant reduction in the level of agreement, as shown in Figure 3.3.\n\n\nCode\nbelieve_vars &lt;- c(\"sbeqsoc\", \"sblazy\", \"sblwcoa\", \"sbprvpv\", \"sbstrec\")\n\ndf_ess &lt;- df_ess |&gt; mutate(across(all_of(believe_vars), ~ 6 - .x, .names = \"{.col}_inv\"))\n\nbelieve_vars_inv &lt;- c(\"sbeqsoc_inv\", \"sblazy_inv\", \"sblwcoa_inv\", \"sbprvpv_inv\", \"sbstrec_inv\")\n\n\n(df_ess |&gt;\n    filter(essround %in% c(4, 8)) |&gt; \n    group_by(round = as_factor(essround))  |&gt; \n    summarise(across(all_of(believe_vars_inv), ~ weighted.mean(.x, w = pspwght, na.rm = T))) |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(cols = -round, names_to = \"Question\", values_to = \"mean\") |&gt; \n    mutate(Question = case_match(\n        Question, \n        \"sbeqsoc_inv\" ~ \"Lead to equal society\", \n        \"sblazy_inv\" ~ \"Make people lazy\", \n        \"sblwcoa_inv\" ~ \"Make people less willing to care\",\n        \"sbstrec_inv\" ~ \"Put strain on economy\",\n        \"sbprvpv_inv\" ~ \"Prevent poverty\"\n    )) |&gt; \n    ggplot(aes(x = round, y = mean, group = Question, color = Question)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_line() +\n    # geom_label(aes(label = round(mean, 1)))+\n    theme_classic()) |&gt; \n    ggplotly()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Mean values for beliefs in relation to social benefits by round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCA\nA Principal Components Analysis indicate that these five variables can be reduced to the following two latent dimensions named arbitrarily:\n\nProtective (PC1): “Lead to equal society” and “Prevent poverty”;\n\nDisincentive (PC2): “Make people lazy” and “Make people less willing to care”, and “Put strain on economy”.\n\nThe variables were aggregated within each dimension using the mean value of the non-missing answers. The Table 3.1 below shows the coefficients of two OLS explanatory models for these two dimensions.\nThe first model indicates that female respondents tend to provide a slightly lower score on the protective dimension of beliefs about social benefits. None of the other predictors included in the model are statistically significant.\nThe second model suggests that the group of “small business owners” and “skilled workers” have higher scores compared to respondents of other social classes. In addition, respondents with worse self-reported financial situation tend to disagree more with beliefs related to disincentive dimension of social beliefs.\n\n\nCode\nvars_protect &lt;- c(\"sbeqsoc_inv\", \"sbprvpv_inv\")\nvars_disinctv &lt;- c(\"sblazy_inv\", \"sblwcoa_inv\", \"sbstrec_inv\")\n\ndf_ess$protective &lt;- rowMeans(select(df_ess, all_of(vars_protect)), na.rm = T)\ndf_ess$disincentive &lt;- rowMeans(select(df_ess, all_of(vars_disinctv)), na.rm = T)\n\nmodel_belief &lt;- function(DV){\n    model &lt;- as.formula(paste0(DV, \"~ factor(essround) + agea + as_factor(gndr) + as_factor(class5) + as_factor(hincfel)\"))\n\n    lm(model, weights = pspwght, data = df_ess) |&gt; \n        tbl_regression(include = c(\"agea\", \"as_factor(gndr)\", \"as_factor(class5)\", \"as_factor(hincfel)\"))  |&gt; \n        bold_p(t = 0.05, q = FALSE) \n}\n\n\ntbl_merge(\n    tbls = map(c(\"protective\", \"disincentive\"), model_belief),\n    tab_spanner = c(\"**Protective**\", \"**Disincentive**\")) |&gt; \n    as_gt() |&gt;\n    gt::tab_source_note(\"Time fixed effects (ESS Round) omitted from the table but included in the model\") |&gt; \n    tab_options(table.width = pct(80))\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: OLS regression coefficients for ‘beliefs about social benefits’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Characteristic\n      \n        Protective\n      \n      \n        Disincentive\n      \n    \n    \n      Beta\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n      Beta\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    Age of respondent, calculated\n0.00\n0.00, 0.00\n&lt;0.001\n0.00\n0.00, 0.00\n0.9\n    as_factor(gndr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Male\n—\n—\n\n—\n—\n\n        Female\n-0.07\n-0.12, -0.03\n0.002\n0.03\n-0.02, 0.08\n0.3\n    Final Oesch class position - 5 classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Higher-grade service class\n—\n—\n\n—\n—\n\n        Lower-grade service class\n-0.03\n-0.12, 0.05\n0.4\n0.09\n0.00, 0.17\n0.051\n        Small business owners\n-0.05\n-0.14, 0.04\n0.3\n0.12\n0.03, 0.21\n0.009\n        Skilled workers\n-0.01\n-0.08, 0.07\n0.9\n0.09\n0.01, 0.16\n0.023\n        Unskilled workers\n0.00\n-0.07, 0.08\n&gt;0.9\n0.08\n0.00, 0.16\n0.056\n    as_factor(hincfel)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Living comfortably on present income\n—\n—\n\n—\n—\n\n        Coping on present income\n-0.03\n-0.08, 0.02\n0.3\n-0.03\n-0.08, 0.03\n0.3\n        Difficult on present income\n-0.07\n-0.15, 0.00\n0.067\n-0.22\n-0.30, -0.14\n&lt;0.001\n        Very difficult on present income\n-0.06\n-0.18, 0.05\n0.3\n-0.48\n-0.61, -0.36\n&lt;0.001\n        Refusal\n-0.20\n-1.3, 0.87\n0.7\n-0.46\n-1.6, 0.65\n0.4\n        Don't know\n0.84\n0.39, 1.3\n&lt;0.001\n-0.53\n-1.0, -0.05\n0.029\n  \n  \n    \n      Time fixed effects (ESS Round) omitted from the table but included in the model\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeuleman, Bart, Wim Van Oorschot, Dimitri Gugushvili, Sharon Baute, Sam Delespaul, Tijs Laenen, Femke Roosma, and Federica Rossetti. 2018. “The Past, Present and Future of European Welfare Attitudes: Topline Results from Round 8 of the European Social Survey.” ESS Topline Series.",

    "text": "4.1 Time series\nAs shown in Figure 2.1, the ESS data indicates a slightly higher average support for redistribution after the 2008 economic crisis and after the 2022 Covid19 pandemic. Evidence from a survey experiment in the USA show that participants are more willing to prioritize society’s problems when exposed to issues related to the pandemic (cappelen_solidarity_2021?). Van Hootegem and Laenen (hootegem_wave_2023?) show that the increase in support for a universal basic income increased with the pandemic but it was short lived.\nIn this section we explore further the potential impact of the pandemic on support for redistribution.\nTable 2.2 suggests that both social class and feeling about household income are significant predictors of support for redistribution. Figure 4.1 shows that the difference between subjective income groups remains stable over time, with all groups responding similar to 2008 crisis and the pandemic.\nCode\nget_series &lt;- function(myvar){\n\n(df_ess |&gt;\n    filter(!is.na(get(myvar))) |&gt; \n    group_by(round = as_factor(essround), class = as_factor(get(myvar)))  |&gt; \n    mutate(gincdif_inv = 6 - gincdif) |&gt; \n    summarise(\n        mean = weighted.mean(gincdif_inv, w = pspwght, na.rm = T),\n        se = sd(gincdif_inv, na.rm = T)/sqrt(length((gincdif_inv)))) |&gt; \n    ggplot(aes(x = round, y = mean, ymin = mean - 1.96*se, ymax = mean + 1.96*se, group = class, color = class)) +\n    geom_pointrange() +\n    geom_line()+\n    ylim(3,4.5)+\n    theme_classic()) |&gt; \n    ggplotly()  |&gt; \n    layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0.4, y = -0.2))\n}\n\nget_series(\"hincfel\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Average support for redistribution by financial situation (2002-2022)\nConversely, the Figure 4.2 suggests that there is a slightly different pattern in response to the pandemic. There is a trajectory of increasing support for redistribution across skilled and unskilled workers since round 8 (2016). However, for lower-grade service class and small business owners, there seems to be a break in this trajectory captured in the latest wave.\nCode\nget_series(\"class5\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Average support for redistribution by social class (2002-2022)",
