## Conclusions and policy implications

- Strong support for Irish government to reduce income differences, especially to address “unfairly low income” of those in the bottom income decile. 

- Support for redistribution higher among low-income households, females, younger people. 

- Higher than EU-average level of support for higher taxes conditional of providing better public services (may be motivated by self-interest but also related to support for redistribution)  

## Conclusions and policy implications

- Pandemic, which saw a sharp increase in government social transfers, was associated with an increase in support for redistribution, especially among those directly effected  

- Negative stereotypes about welfare recipients may undermine this support

- Importance of communication of the role of social protection in addressing risks and the rights/entitlements of citizens
