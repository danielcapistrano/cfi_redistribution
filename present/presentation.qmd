# Literature {.inverted}


## Societal level influences 

- Higher support for redistribution in countries with higher inequality [@velev_economic_2024; @finseraas_income_2009]  

- Support for redistribution remained apparently stable over time [@lupu_unequal_2023] and could be related to lack of major political reaction to income inequality.     


## Socio-demographic predictors 

- Women are more progressive in relation to policy preferences and support for redistribution [@shorrocks_attitudinal_2020; @inglehart_cultural_2018; @grasso_are_2025]  

-  @steele_wealth_2022 find that older respondents are more favourable of income redistribution.  

- @grasso_are_2025 highlights the association between gender and generation, with the cohorts of women born after 1946 being more supportive of redistribution compared to men in their cohorts  

## Welfare for whom? 

@van_oorschot_social_2017 note that support for welfare policies, social transfers and redistribution is conditional on the social legitimacy of these policies' target groups
