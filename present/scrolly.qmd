## Why narrow the gap?

Many vulnerable individuals and families in Ireland are struggling to make ends meet and are falling into poverty [@roantree_poverty_2025]. Because government resources are limited and there are many competing demands on social welfare funding, it is crucial to understand ['who']{.mark} supports State efforts to reduce income inequalities and to provide welfare, as well as examine ['when']{.mark} and ['why']{.mark} they support these efforts.

@cr-prop1  

@cr-prop2 According to data from the [Euorpean Social Survey](www.europeansocialsurvey.org), three in every four Irish residents agree that the "*government should reduce differences in income*".  


[@cr-map]{pan-to="15%,30%" scale-by="3"} About 76 per cent  of respondents indicated that they either ‘agree’ (45%) or ‘agree strongly’ (31%) with this statement.

[@cr-map]{scale-by="1.1"} This proportion is slightly higher than the European average (71%) and the ones from other northern European countries.

Both female respondents and those who place themselves on the left of the left-right political scale are more likely to support income redistribution, even when controlling for other factors such as age and education. 

Overall, the examination of individual factors associated with support for income redistribution in Ireland goes in the same direction of the literature pointing out the role of material interests (financial situation) and perspectives of upward mobility (social class) [@bonnet_what_2024].
