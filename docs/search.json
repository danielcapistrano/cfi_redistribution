Most of the analysis is based on a core question that was asked across all 11 rounds since 2002.

So, in the results presented here, higher values denote stronger agreement with government reducing income differences.\n\n\nSome recent studies have raised concerns in relation to the reliability of this question as a measurement of support for redistribution. Margalit and Raviv (2024) argues that reduction in income differences is too abstract and respondents in general do not link it to redistributive measures. Similarly, it has been suggested that this question only captures a diffuse inclination to equality and that is why responses are inconsistent with voting preferences across countries Dallinger (2022). However, Breznau et al. (2025) argue that the absence of a relationship between this measurement and other expected correlates (voting preferences / support for concrete policies) is due to the ommission of views on government (trust and perceptions of corruption) as a moderating variable.\n\n\nRelevant variables\nHere are relevant variables from the latest three waves that were also included in the analysis.\n\nPlacement on left right scale\n\nCitizen of country\n\nBorn in country\n\nGender\n\nYear of birth\n\nHighest level of education\n\nFeeling about household’s income nowadays\n\nIn addition, based on the class scheme developed by Oesch (2006), a “social class” variable was constructed based on occupational variables and following Tawfik and Oesch (2020) script.\n\n\n\n\nBreznau, Nate, Lisa Heukamp, Hung HV Nguyen, and Tom Knuf. 2025. “The Moderating Role of Government Heuristics in Public Preferences for Redistribution.” Journal of European Social Policy 35 (1): 21–39. https://doi.org/10.1177/09589287241290742.\n\n\nDallinger, Ursula. 2022. “On the Ambivalence of Preferences for Income Redistribution: A Research Note.” Journal of European Social Policy 32 (2): 225–36. https://doi.org/10.1177/09589287211066469.\n\n\nMargalit, Yotam, and Shir Raviv. 2024. “Does Support for Redistribution Mean What We Think It Means?” Political Science Research and Methods 12 (4): 870–78. https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2023.57.\n\n\nOesch, Daniel. 2006. “Coming to Grips with a Changing Class Structure: An Analysis of Employment Stratification in Britain, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.” International Sociology 21 (2): 263–88. https://doi.org/10.1177/0268580906061379.\n\n\nTawfik, Amal, and Daniel Oesch. 2020. “Script to Construct an Indicator of Social Class in the ESS.” Https://Www.

    "text": "4.1 Time series\nAs shown in Figure 2.1, the ESS data indicates a slightly higher average support for redistribution after the 2008 economic crisis and after the 2022 Covid19 pandemic. Evidence from a survey experiment in the USA show that participants are more willing to prioritize society’s problems when exposed to issues related to the pandemic (Cappelen et al. 2021). Van Hootegem and Laenen (2023) show that the increase in support for a universal basic income increased with the pandemic but it was short lived.\nIn this section we explore further the potential impact of the pandemic on support for redistribution.\nTable 2.2 suggests that both social class and feeling about household income are significant predictors of support for redistribution. Figure 4.1 shows that the difference between subjective income groups remains stable over time, with all groups responding similar to 2008 crisis and the pandemic.\nFigure 4.1: Average support for redistribution by financial situation (2002-2022)\nConversely, the Figure 4.2 suggests that there is a slightly different pattern in response to the pandemic. There is a trajectory of increasing support for redistribution across skilled and unskilled workers since round 8 (2016). However, for lower-grade service class and small business owners, there seems to be a break in this trajectory captured in the latest wave.\nFigure 4.2: Average support for redistribution by social class (2002-2022)",
