    "text": "Why narrow the gap?\nMany vulnerable individuals and families in Ireland are struggling to make ends meet and are falling into poverty (Roantree et al. 2025). Because government resources are limited and there are many competing demands on social welfare funding, it is crucial to understand ‘who’ supports State efforts to reduce income inequalities and to provide welfare, as well as examine ‘when’ and ‘why’ they support these efforts."

This proportion is slightly higher than the European average (71%) and the proportions in other northern European countries (main report)."
